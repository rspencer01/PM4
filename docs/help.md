### Let me buy you a coffee

I'd like to know that this all works.  If you can run the project on a new OS and send me a screenshot (along with some details of how you ran it, what you had to do to get it to work, what operating system and hardware you were using), [I'll buy _you_ a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/).

### Contribute

If you really like the project, I'd love your contributions and pull requests.  Just send them in!
