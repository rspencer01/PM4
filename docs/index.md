## Welcome to Project Magrathea

Project Magrathea is an attempt to make a large, explorable world, procedurally populated with enough things to make it believable.  Currently the world is 64 kilometers on a side and has mountains, trees, villages, roads and people wandering around.

This is an open-ended project, but it is already quite advanced.

Have a look at some of the [screenshots](screenshots.html).

## Running the software

The asset pack for Project Magrathea still needs to be compiled, but when it has been, installation should be as simple as
~~~ bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rspencer01/PM4.git
$ cd PM4
$ unzip assets.zip
$ ./PM4
~~~
The first time you run Project Magrathea, it will take a while (about 10 minutes) to construct all the assets it requires.  However, each time after that it should be very quick to start.

## Helping out

I'd love to have some help with this project.  Its been a labor of love for over four years (in various forms) for me.  [See how you can help.](help.html)
